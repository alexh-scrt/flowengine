## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-15

Richer graph execution: edge **conditions** and **async** components in the
`GraphExecutor`. All additions are non-breaking — the synchronous `execute()`
path is unchanged, and existing flows behave identically.

### Added

- **Edge conditions** — `GraphEdgeConfig` gains an optional `condition` Python
  expression (evaluated against `context`, e.g. `context.data.score > 0.5`). An
  edge activates only when its **port matches** *and* its **condition is True**.
  Evaluation errors follow `FlowSettings.on_condition_error` (`fail` re-raises;
  `skip`/`warn` deactivate the edge, recording it in
  `metadata.condition_errors`). `GraphExecutor` now accepts an optional
  `evaluator` (wired from `FlowEngine.evaluator`).
- **Async graph execution** — `GraphExecutor.execute_async()` plus async mirrors
  (`_execute_dag_async`, `_execute_cyclic_async`, `_execute_node_async`) that
  `await` components whose `process` returns a coroutine. Sync components run
  inline on the async path too, so a graph may mix sync and async components.
  Routing, port/condition gating, cyclic/`max_iterations` handling, suspension,
  and hooks are identical to the sync path — letting higher-level runtimes (e.g.
  NeuroCore) route async-skill graph flows through the canonical graph engine.

### Notes

- Port-based routing and cyclic execution with `max_iterations` / per-node
  `max_visits` were already present (v0.2.0 / v0.3.0); this release adds the
  missing condition + async pieces so realistic conditional, looping, async
  graphs execute end-to-end.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-13

Agent-native release: FlowEngine YAML becomes a constrained **Agent Workflow IR**
that AI agents (and NeuroCore) can generate, validate, run, observe, and repair.
All additions are non-breaking — existing flows, components, and the public API
are unchanged. See `design/v0.5.0_agent_native.md`. New API lives under
`flowengine.agent` and is re-exported from the top-level `flowengine` package.

### Added

- **Component & contract metadata** (`flowengine.agent.meta`)
  - `ComponentMeta` capability manifest (inputs/outputs/ports/tags/cost/risk/effects/
    requires_approval/requires_llm); `BaseComponent.get_meta()` (optional, defaults to `None`).
  - `IOFieldSpec` + top-level `inputs`/`outputs` on `FlowConfig` — a declarative worker contract.
  - `PortSpec` for declaring named output ports.

- **Machine-readable validation** (`flowengine.agent.issues`, `semantic`, `compiler`)
  - `FlowIssue` (stable `IssueCode`, document `path`, `suggestion`), `RepairSuggestion`
    + `JsonPatchOp` (RFC-6902) for self-correcting agents.
  - `validate_semantics()` — ports declared, reachability, cycle exits, terminal output,
    input producers, output contract, approval surfacing. Degrades to warnings without metadata.
  - `FlowCompiler.compile_yaml()` → `CompileResult{valid, flow_config, errors, warnings,
    normalized_yaml}` with "did you mean" component suggestions.

- **Agent tooling** (`flowengine.agent`)
  - `explain()`/`FlowPlan` — dry-run plan (execution order, branches, cycles, required
    components, context I/O).
  - `AgentTrace.from_context()` — structured run trace (run_id, status, outputs, steps, errors).
  - `normalize_yaml()` — canonical, diff-friendly YAML.
  - `build_catalog()` — machine-readable component catalog.
  - `export_json_schema()` — JSON Schema export (flow/component/graph/component-meta) for
    constrained generation.
  - `apply_patch()` — minimal RFC-6902 JSON Patch applier.

- **Safety / sandbox** (`flowengine.agent.policy`)
  - `ExecutionPolicy` (allow/deny lists, risk & approval gates, resource caps) enforced
    statically at compile time and at runtime via `apply_to_config()`.
  - `PolicyViolationError`.

- **Composition**
  - `FlowTool` — expose a whole flow as a callable, schema-bearing tool (flow-as-tool).
  - `SubflowComponent` (`flowengine.contrib.subflow`) — run a nested flow as a component,
    with input/output mapping, namespacing, and recursion guard.

- **Templates, replay & docs**
  - 7 canonical flow templates + `flowengine.agent.templates` (`list_templates`/`get_template`).
  - `RunRecord`/`RunStore`/`InMemoryRunStore` + `replay()` for deterministic replay.
  - `docs/for-agents/` prompt pack (system-prompt, yaml-generation-rules,
    validation-error-repair, component-selection, safety-policy).

- **CLI** — new `flowengine` console script: `validate`, `plan`, `schema`, `normalize`,
  `apply-patch`, `components`, `template`, `run`, `replay` (most support `--json`).

- **NeuroCore bridge** — NeuroCore `Skill.get_meta()` now derives a `ComponentMeta` from
  its `SkillMeta` (`provides→outputs`, `consumes→inputs`, tags/config_schema/requires_llm);
  `SkillRegistry.component_catalog()` surfaces skills in the FlowEngine catalog. Requires
  `flowengine>=0.5.0`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **`on_iteration_complete` hook now fires** — called after each iteration finishes (at back-edge re-entry for the previous iteration, and at natural loop exit for the final iteration). Includes iteration number, cycle entry node, context, and duration.
- **`on_max_iterations` hook now fires** — called when the iteration limit is reached, before the policy (fail/exit/warn) is applied. Includes max_iterations value, cycle entry node, and context.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Cyclic Graph Execution** (`max_iterations` + ready-queue BFS)
  - Graphs with cycles are now executed via a ready-queue BFS executor
  - Cycle detection via DFS with white/gray/black coloring identifies back-edges
  - Iteration counting at back-edge targets with configurable `max_iterations` limit
  - Three `on_max_iterations` policies: `fail` (raise `MaxIterationsError`), `exit` (silent stop), `warn` (log + stop)
  - Per-node `max_visits` limit to cap individual node executions
  - DAG fast path preserved untouched — zero behavioral change for acyclic graphs

- **`MaxIterationsError` Exception**
  - New exception with `max_iterations`, `actual_iterations`, and `cycle_entry_node` attributes
  - Raised when `on_max_iterations: fail` and the iteration limit is reached

- **Cyclic Execution Metadata**
  - `ExecutionMetadata.node_visit_counts`: per-node visit tracking (source of truth for cyclic flows)
  - `ExecutionMetadata.iteration_count`: total iteration count across all cycles
  - `ExecutionMetadata.max_iterations_reached`: flag indicating whether the limit was hit
  - Full round-trip serialization of cyclic state via `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`

- **Execution Hooks for Cycles**
  - `on_iteration_start(iteration, context)`: called at each iteration boundary
  - `on_iteration_complete(iteration, context)`: called after each iteration completes
  - `on_max_iterations(iteration, policy, context)`: called when max iterations is reached

- **Checkpoint/Resume in Cyclic Flows**
  - Suspend and resume works within cyclic execution paths
  - Visit counts and iteration state preserved across checkpoint boundaries

- **New Flow Settings**
  - `max_iterations` (default: 10): maximum iteration count for cyclic graphs
  - `on_max_iterations` (default: `"fail"`): policy when limit is reached
  - `max_visits` on `GraphNodeConfig`: per-node visit cap

- **Agent Loop Example** (`examples/agent_loop.py`)
  - Runnable example demonstrating `plan → execute → observe → evaluate → [refine|deliver]`
  - YAML configuration in `examples/flows/agent_loop.yaml`

### Changed

- `GraphExecutor.execute()` now dispatches to `_execute_dag()` or `_execute_cyclic()` based on cycle detection
- Previous `execute()` renamed to `_execute_dag()` (no behavioral change for DAG flows)
- Shared `_execute_node()` method extracted for both DAG and cyclic paths
- Cycle-participating nodes are NOT added to `completed_nodes` (only terminal/non-cycle nodes are)
- `FlowEngine.dry_run()` returns all components for cyclic graphs instead of topological sort

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-10

### Added

- **Graph-Based DAG Execution** (`flow.type: "graph"`)
  - Topological ordering via Kahn's algorithm
  - `GraphNodeConfig` and `GraphEdgeConfig` schema models
  - `GraphExecutor` class in `core/graph.py`
  - Cycle detection with clear error messages

- **Port-Based Output Routing**
  - Components can signal an active output port via `set_output_port(context, port)`
  - Graph edges with `port` field route conditionally based on active port
  - `FlowContext.set_port()`, `get_active_port()`, `clear_port()` methods
  - Unconditional edges (no port) always activate

- **Async Component Support**
  - `BaseComponent.process_async()` with automatic sync fallback
  - `BaseComponent.is_async` property for detection
  - Full async lifecycle support

- **Execution Checkpoints (Suspend/Resume)**
  - `FlowContext.suspend(node_id, reason)` for pausing flows mid-execution
  - `Checkpoint` dataclass with full JSON serialization
  - `CheckpointStore` abstract base class with `InMemoryCheckpointStore` implementation
  - `FlowEngine.resume(checkpoint_id, resume_data)` for continuing suspended flows
  - Suspended nodes re-execute on resume (not skipped)

- **Step Lifecycle Hooks**
  - `ExecutionHook` Protocol with five hook points:
    `on_node_start`, `on_node_complete`, `on_node_error`, `on_node_skipped`, `on_flow_suspended`
  - Hooks are fault-tolerant — broken hooks don't break flow execution
  - Multiple hooks supported simultaneously

- **Enhanced FlowDefinition Validation**
  - `model_validator` ensures correct fields for each flow type
  - Graph-specific validation: unique node IDs, valid edge references
  - Backward-compatible: `steps` remains for sequential/conditional flows

### Changed

- `FlowEngine.__init__` accepts optional `checkpoint_store` and `hooks` parameters
- `FlowEngine.from_config` accepts optional `checkpoint_store` and `hooks` parameters
- `FlowDefinition.type` now accepts `"graph"` in addition to `"sequential"` and `"conditional"`
- `FlowDefinition.steps` is now optional (not required for graph flows)
- `ExecutionMetadata` includes `suspended`, `suspended_at_node`, `suspension_reason`, `completed_nodes` fields
- Context serialization includes suspension and completed_nodes state
